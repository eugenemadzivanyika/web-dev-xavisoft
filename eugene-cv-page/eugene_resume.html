                        Students in Grades 4 to 6 had limited computer skills and no exposure to
                        programming. I taught basic computer skills and introduced Scratch coding
                        through interactive, project-based lessons. Students gained confidence in using
                        computers and created their own Scratch projects, improving their digital
                        literacy and problem-solving abilities.
